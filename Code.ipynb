    "\n",
    "We are analyzing the commuting preferences of graduate students during the winter season when only driving or taking the bus are feasible options due to severe weather conditions. This study will assist the university in optimizing parking and bus transportation needs during the winter months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we are investigating the commuting choices of graduate students in the spring, when biking and walking become viable alternatives. This research will support the university in planning for car parking, bike rack availability, and bus transportation during the spring season. Moreover, the university is considering adjustments to bus routes and aims to understand how these changes may influence students' commuting decisions."

    "The analysis utilizes two datasets, both derived from simulated data on the commuting choices of 1,000 graduate students who commute to campus from distances greater than one mile. These datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/Oishika-Kar/Analyzing-and-Predicting-Commuting-Choices-of-Graduate-Students/blob/3652e98d42cb97087f1ec622f69a43ee31ff9546/commute_datasets.zip.zip). Detailed descriptions of the variables in each dataset are available in the \"commute_descriptions.txt\" file.\n",

    "1. **commute_binary.csv**: This dataset contains information on students' commuting choices during the winter season, when only two options are feasible due to severe weather conditions: driving a car or taking a bus. This dataset will help the university plan for parking and bus transportation needs during the winter months.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **commute_multinomial.csv**: This dataset includes data on commuting choices during the spring season, when weather conditions allow for additional options. Students can choose from four commuting modes: driving a car, taking a bus, biking, or walking. This dataset will aid the university in planning for car parking, bike rack availability, and bus transportation during the spring. Additionally, the university is considering adjustments to bus routes and seeks to understand how these changes might influence students' commuting decisions."
