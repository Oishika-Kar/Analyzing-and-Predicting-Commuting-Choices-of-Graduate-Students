# Analyzing-and-Predicting-Commuting-Choices-of-Graduate-Students

# Objective
We are analyzing the commuting preferences of graduate students during the winter seasonwhen only driving or taking the bus are feasible options due to severe weather conditions.This study will assist the university in optimizing parking and bus transportation needsduring the winter months.
Additionally, we are investigating the commuting choices of graduate students in the spring,when biking and walking become viable alternatives. This research will support theuniversity in planning for car parking, bike rack availability, and bus transportation during thespring season. Moreover, the university is considering adjustments to bus routes and aimsto understand how these changes may influence students' commuting decisions.

# Data:
The analysis utilizes two datasets, both derived from simulated data on the commutingchoices of 1,000 graduate students who commute to campus from distances greater thanone mile. These datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/Oishika-Kar/Analyzing-and-Predicting-Commuting-Choices-of-Graduate-Students/blob/3652e98d42cb97087f1ec622f69a43ee31ff9546/commute_datasets.zip.zip)
Detailed descriptions of the variables in each dataset are available in the"commute_descriptions.txt" file.

# commute_binary.csv
This dataset contains information on students' commutingchoices during the winter season, when only two options are feasible due to severeweather conditions: driving a car or taking a bus. This dataset will help the universityplan for parking and bus transportation needs during the winter months.

# commute_multinomial.csv
This dataset includes data on commuting choices duringthe spring season, when weather conditions allow for additional options. Students canchoose from four commuting modes: driving a car, taking a bus, biking, or walking. Thisdataset will aid the university in planning for car parking, bike rack availability, and bustransportation during the spring. Additionally, the university is considering adjustmentsto bus routes and seeks to understand how these changes might influence students'commuting decisions.
